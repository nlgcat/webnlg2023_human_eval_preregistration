# WebNLG 2023 Human Evaluation Pre-registration
This repository contains all of the pre-registration resources for the WebNLG 2023 Human Evaluation.  Due to a formatting issue when exporting Google Sheets to Microsoft Excel, all spreadsheets are stored on Google Drive ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIqOM45SAkZWPLQ4_ejqdpThmVrAbJu5?usp=sharing)).  Within this GitHub repository, placeholder .txt files have been included to mark where a spreadsheet should be.  The spreadsheets can be found via the above Google Drive link, which follows the same directory structure.

## Pre-registration
The experiment has been pre-registered on [ASPREDICTED](https://aspredicted.org](https://aspredicted.org/lookup.php).  The registration number is 139263 and the first registered author name is Thomson.

## Quality Criteria Definitions
We use the [QCET Taxonomy spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OekYUSgu7YvG-9IOWK2S5RB9-sJKtHc6aHJZQLw7H7o/edit?usp=drive_link) which is an extended version of Taxonomy created by [Howcroft et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.inlg-1.23)

## Human Evaluation Datasheet (HEDS)
We use a modified version of [Shimorina and Belz 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.humeval-1.6), more specifically the version created for the [ReproHum project](https://reprohum.github.io).  To view the HEDS download the ZIP file that contains the web interface, [heds_2022_11_18.zip](https://github.com/nlgcat/webnlg2023_human_eval_preregistration/blob/main/heds_2022_11_18.zip), extract it, and then open the .html file in a browser.  Then, load the JSON file, ([HEDS-WebNLG2023-2023-07-24-11-48-00.json](https://github.com/nlgcat/webnlg2023_human_eval_preregistration/blob/main/HEDS-WebNLG2023-2023-07-24-11-48-00.json))) following the on-screen instructions.  The completed HEDS can then be viewed.

## Repro-HEDS datasheet
Also included is a [Repro-HEDS datasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fv-XB4z7Gt7KLCIIqUOjMyXhVg7UW_boy7zoG4agXY/edit?usp=drive_link) which describes further properties of the experiment.  Definitions for each property can be found in the [Repro-HEDS Manual]([#](https://github.com/nlgcat/webnlg2023_human_eval_preregistration/blob/main/Repro-HEDS%20Manual.docx)).

## Pre-Information for Translation Agencies
A Pre-Information document [Pre-Information for Translation Agencies](https://github.com/nlgcat/webnlg2023_human_eval_preregistration/blob/main/Pre-Information%20for%20Translation%20Agencies_.docx) was given to translation agencies to describe the type of work required.

## Training and Practice Resources
Before completing their main batch of assigned work, participants are asked to:
1. A README document in which participants are shown initial instructions can be found here; [README FIRST.docx](https://github.com/nlgcat/webnlg2023_human_eval_preregistration/blob/main/WebNLG2023%20Human%20Evaluation%20Spreadsheets/Evaluation%20Forms%20and%20Items/Online%20Training%20Session%20for%20Translators/README%20FIRST.docx).
2. A pre-evaluation questionnaire where they confirm their eligibility for the experiment can be found here; [Step 1: Pre-evaluation Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZc0XIr9C4KLEKtACKT8hQVpAImdmxPYVP6rJuj_5zg/edit?usp=drive_link).
3. The participant instructions can be found here; [Step 2: Instructions for Evaluators.docx](https://github.com/nlgcat/webnlg2023_human_eval_preregistration/blob/main/WebNLG2023%20Human%20Evaluation%20Spreadsheets/Evaluation%20Forms%20and%20Items/Online%20Training%20Session%20for%20Translators/Step%202_%20Instructions%20for%20Evaluators.docx).
4. Practice work with 10 English language items (same for each participant) can be found here; [Step 3: Evaluation Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hnYh_oHQrVMsPgyGkOwtlTgCyEcJpBiMlx2ipQsnFss/edit?usp=drive_link).

## Evaluation Interface and Items
A copy of each Google Sheet that a participant will complete can be found on Google Drive ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIqOM45SAkZWPLQ4_ejqdpThmVrAbJu5?usp=sharing)).  Together, these sheets contain all evaluation items.
