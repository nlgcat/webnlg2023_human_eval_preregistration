# WebNLG 2023 Human Evaluation Pre-registration
This repository contains all of the pre-registration resources for the WebNLG 2023 Human Evaluation.  Due to a formatting issue when exporting Google Sheets to Microsoft Excel, all spreadsheets are stored on Google Drive ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIqOM45SAkZWPLQ4_ejqdpThmVrAbJu5?usp=sharing)).  Within this GitHub repository, placeholder .txt files have been included to mark where a spreadsheet should be.  The spreadsheets can be found via the above Google Drive link, which follows the same directory structure.

## Pre-registration
The experiment has been pre-registered on [ASPREDICTED](https://aspredicted.org).  The registration number is [TODO](#).

## Quality Criteria Definitions
We use the [QCET Taxonomy spreadsheet]() which is an extended version of Taxonomy created by [Howcroft et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.inlg-1.23)

## Human Evaluation Datasheet (HEDS)
We use modified version of [Shimorina and Belz 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.humeval-1.6), more specifically the version created for the [ReproHum project](https://reprohum.github.io).  To view the HEDS sheet download the ZIP file that contains the web interface [TODO](#), extract it, and then open the .html file in a browser.  Then, load the JSON file [TODO](#) following the the on-screen instructions.  If the HEDS sheet is updated, a new JSON file like the above must be downloaded to save it.

## Repro-HEDS datasheet
Also included is a [Repro-HEDS datasheet]() which describes further properties of the experiment.  Definitions for each property can be found in the [Repro-HEDS Manual](#).

## Pre-Information for Translation Agencies
A Pre-Information document was given to Translation Agencies to describe the type of work required.  This document can be found [here](#).

## Training and Practive Resources
Before completing their main batch of assigned work, participants are asked to:
1. A README document which participants are shown first can be found [here](#).
2. A pre-evaluation questionnaire where they confirm their eligibility for the experiment can be found [here](#).
3. The participant instructions can be found [here](#).
4. Practice work with 10 English language items (same for each participant) can be found [here](#).


## Evaluation Interface and Items
A copy of the Google Sheet that each participant will complete can be found on Google Drive ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIqOM45SAkZWPLQ4_ejqdpThmVrAbJu5?usp=sharing)).  Together, they contain all evaluation items.
